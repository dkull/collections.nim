# collections.nim

Library containing advanced collection types and miscellaneous utilities involving iteration.

Notes about the fork:

This repository is forked. The original author created projects `collections.nim` and `capnp.nim`. The latter depends on the former. Both are unmaintained in their original repositories.
This fork will try to keep this library working for my personal fork of `capnp.nim`.
Neither forks are intended to diverge much, but you never know.

My actual goal: https://github.com/dkull/capnp.nim
